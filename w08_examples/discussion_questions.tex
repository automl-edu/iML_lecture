Q1) When would you use an adversarial attack vs a counterfactual example ? And when would you prefer a counterfactual example ?

Q2) What constraints in generating counterfactuals are easy to optimize -- sparsity, plausibility, causality ?

Q3) Why would you prefer influential examples over adversarial attacks ?
