\begin{enumerate}
\item In which application scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving) would you explain a machine learning model?
\item Under which conditions (e.g., of your model or your data) would you use fANOVA and/or feature permutation importance?
\item What could be advantages and disadvantages of interpretable models vs. interpreting models post-hoc?
\end{enumerate}
